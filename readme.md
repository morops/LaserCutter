This is the design for a laser cutter controlled by an Arduino Uno running grbl. More updates are to follow. Note: If you are trying to open the assemblies with solidworks, some of the files have moved around a bit. It may prompt you for the locations of the logo and warning labels (although these are not important to the design itself). The pngs for those files are now located in the LaserCutter/Images directory.

Todo:

-Upload STL CAD files/provide an alternate format than solidworks

-Upload grbl code
